## Localization

If you would like to contribute new translations, or enhancements to the existing ones, please fork and submit a pull request on this repository. In the pull request, please include an explanation of the changes being made and what implications it may have. 

> Note that the English version of the disclaimer has the most important parts in **bold font**, and the rest can be safely omitted if it makes the text easier to understand, and/or more concise to fit better within the space available.

If another speaker of the language in question can vouch to the accuracy of the translation, that will speed things along. We will review with the TripSit community prior to rolling out any new translations or changes to existing verbiage.
